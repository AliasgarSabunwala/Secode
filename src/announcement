"Secode", a program that can scan source code
and identify out potential security flaws, ranking them by likely severity.
Secode is completely open source / free software
(it's released under the GPL license).

Secode will miss some security problems, and point out issues that aren't
really security problems, but nevertheless I think it can help track
down security problems in code so that the code can be fixed.


Secode is in its very early stages -
