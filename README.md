# Secode
- Secode is Insecure Code Detector tool, that analyzes your code, to find Anomalies in your codes say Insecure Functions, that makes your code insecure. 
- But, it doesn't stops there, it as a precautionary measure, provides you with safer function alternatives like for use of `strcpy()` you must use Secure alternative's like `lstrcy()`, that you can implement on your code, to make it Safe and Secure.

# How it's Different
- Secode is powered by a **stringent and comprehensive ruleset**, that can detect vulnerabilities pretty easily, which is updated regularly, 
as more vulnerabilities and exploits emerge.
- Secode enforces the concept of "**Secure Coding" and "Secure Software Devloepment Life Cycle (Secure SDLC)"** which is now gaining much needed attention during the 
development process of any software
- **But, it doesn't stops there, _it provides you with safer function alternatives like for use of `strcpy()` you must use Secure alternative's like `lstrcy()`, that you can implement on your code, to make it Safe and Secure._**

## What Does Secode Scan on The Code(s) You Provide?
- Vulnerability at hand
- CWE Number associated with it
- A brief description about the vulnerability
- Secure alternative(s) that you must use which are totally safe from exploits.

## Roadmap
- Dockerize to provide support across all platforms
- Extending Scanning functionalities within the tool to: 
    1. Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, Js and PHP
    2. App Development languages like Java and Kotlin
- GitHub Actions workflows Integration.
