# Secode
Detecting Insecure Code and making your code
Secure!

## Description

SeCode is a CLI-based tool, that analyzes your C code, to find anomalies (insecure functions), that make your make your code insecure. As a precautionary measure, it will provide you with safer function alternatives, that you can implement on your code, to make it less exploitable.

SeCode is powered by a stringent and comprehensive ruleset, that can detect vulnerabilities pretty easily. Please understand that the ruleset will be updated regularly,as more vulnerabilities and exploits emerge, with use of insecure functions

SeCode enforces the concept of 'Secure Coding', an often overlooked topic, during the development process of any software 

## What does a SeCode scan on the submitted code provide?

- Vulnerability at hand
- CWE Number associated with it
- A brief description about the vulnerability
- Alternative function that you can use - which is totally safe from exploits
